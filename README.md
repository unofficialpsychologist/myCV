# CV

Stealing this CV format/template from Alex Albright. In process of figuring it out!

This repo includes the code for generating my academic CV. 

The `R markdown` file is `alex-albright-cv.Rmd` and calls on the style in `svm-latex-cv.tex`, which is [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/)'s template. The final product is `alex-albright-cv.pdf`.
